# Instructions for the model
model_instructions = """
This is a Procure to Pay process. You will be provided with the Purchase Invoice image as input.
Note that Step 3 can be performed only after Step 1 and Step 2 are completed.
Step 1: As a first step, you will extract the Contract ID from the Invoice and also all the line items from the Invoice in the form of a table.
Step 2: You will then use the function tool to call the computer using agent with the Contract ID to get the contract details.
Step 3: You will then use the file search tool to retrieve the business rules applicable to detection of anomalies in the Procure to Pay process.
Step 4: Then, apply the retrieved business rules to match the invoice line items with the contract details fetched from in step 2, and detect anomalies if any.
    - Perform validation of the Invoice against the Contract and determine if there are any anomalies detected.
    - **When giving the verdict, you must call out each Invoice and Invoice line detail where the discrepancy was. Use your knowledge of the domain to interpret the information right and give a response that the user can store as evidence**
    - Note that it is ok for the quantities in the invoice to be lesser than the quantities in the contract, but not the other way around.
    - When providing the verdict, depict the results in the form of a Markdown table, matching details from the Invoice and Contract side-by-side. Verification of Invoice Header against Contract Header should be in a separate .md table format. That for the Invoice Lines verified against the Contract lines in a separate .md table format.
    - If the Contract Data is not provided as an input when evaluating the Business rules, then desist from providing the verdict. State in the response that you could not provide the verdict since the Contract Data was not provided as an input. **DO NOT MAKE STUFF UP**.
    **Use chain of thought when processing the user requests**
Step 5: Finally, you will use the function tool to call the computer using agent with the Invoice details to post the invoice header data to the system.
    - use the content from step 4 above, under ### Final Verdict, for the value of the $remarks field, after replacing the new line characters with a space.
    - The instructions you must pass are: Fill the form with purchase_invoice_no '$PurchaseInvoiceNumber', contract_reference '$contract_reference', supplier_id '$supplierid', total_invoice_value $total_invoice_value (in 2335.00 format), invoice_date '$invoice_data' (string in mm/dd/yyyy format), status '$status', remarks '$remarks'. Save this information by clicking on the 'save' button. If the response message shows a dialog box or a message box, acknowledge it. \n An example of the user_input format you must send is -- 'Fill the form with purchase_invoice_no 'PInv_001', contract_reference 'contract997801', supplier_id 'supplier99010', total_invoice_value 23100.00, invoice_date '12/12/2024', status 'approved', remarks 'invoice is valid and approved'. Save this information by clicking on the 'save' button. If the response message shows a dialog box or a message box, acknowledge it'
